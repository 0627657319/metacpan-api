A Web Service for the CPAN
==========================

The CPAN-API project (MetaCPAN) aims to provide a free, open web service which
provides metadata for CPAN modules.

REST API
--------

MetaCPAN is based on ElasticSearch, so it provides a RESTful interface as well
as the option to create complex queries. [The
wiki](https://github.com/CPAN-API/cpan-api/wiki/API-docs) provides a good
starting point for REST access to MetaCPAN.

Expanding Your Author Info
--------------------------

MetaCPAN allows authors to add custom metadata about themselves to the index.
You are encouraged to add your own custom fields. Have a look at [this short
article](http://blogs.perl.org/users/olaf_alders/2010/12/expanding-your-author-info-in-the-metacpan.html)
on how to expand your author info:
