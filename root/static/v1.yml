                  # "\"Moo\" is an extremely light-weight Object Orientation system. It allows one to concisely define objects and roles with a convenient syntax that avoids the details of Perl's object system. \"Moo\" contains a subset of Moose and is optimised for rapid startup. \"Moo\" avoids depending on any XS modules to allow for simple deployments. The name \"Moo\" is based on the idea that it provides almost -- but not quite -- two thirds of Moose. Unlike Mouse this module does not aim at full compatibility with Moose's surface syntax, preferring instead to provide full interoperability via the metaclass inflation capabilities described in \"MOO AND MOOSE\". For a full list of the minor differences between Moose and Moo's surface syntax, see \"INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH MOOSE\".",
